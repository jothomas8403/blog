## The Art of Detailing: Why it’s More than Just a Clean

If you live in the United States, I have a good feeling that you are part of the 91% that owns a car. I am also fairly positive that you use it at least once a week, regardless of the weather. Yet despite many people using their cars, they often overlook that it needs to be cleaned. As we don’t spend as much time in our cars as we do at home, it is a task that is easily overlooked, but a car is already a depreciating asset, and detailing helps get you the most money at the end of ownership. 
	Unlike the inside of our homes, the paint and plastic that make up a car are almost always exposed to bad weather or the sun. This causes mud and dirt to get trapped in your carpet, the plastic and paint fading, and the exterior getting exposed to corrosive materials. Yet, there is a way to maintain your car's condition, for the many years you own it, that is bound to impress the next buyer.

### What is detailing?
	Detailing is a step above normal maintenance cleaning in your car, attempting to get it to a “like-new” condition, though not always possible. It is separated in two parts: an interior detail, and an exterior detail. 

Interior:
	An interior detail is focused only on the interior of the car. In cars that are less dirty, it includes a thorough vacuuming, attentive cleaning of vinyls, steam cleaning to rid of any pesky stains, carpet shampoo, and finally a UV protective coating on all vinyl, including the seats. 
	Additionally, if it needs extra protection, detailers can perform intense stain removal, pet hair removal, odor removal, and so much more.
	All of the steps are imperative to getting any dirt or grime out of the interior of your car. You deserve a nice clean ride to work, to your appointments, and one that will impress your friends. Interior details keep your interior maintained, looking fresh, and no matter the condition of your car, it feels like you’re driving in luxury. 
Exterior:
	Exterior details freshen up the paint, bringing back the shine to the paint. Detailers work hard to ensure that every imperfection is buffed out, looking like it just left the paint booth. A basic exterior detail follows a five step process: handwash, claybar, buffing, polishing, and a wax coat. There are more intense details that provide extra protection to the paint. (Be on the lookout for my indepth deep dive)
Why Get a Detail:
You deserve to drive in a nice, fresh car. One that smells clean, glistens in the sun, and a cleanliness that impresses your friends. Keeping up on detailing extends the longevity of the color of your interior, carpet, and paint life. Drive your car with absolute confidence and get it detailed. 
Preparing for a Detail? Here’s what you need to know
	Dropping off your car at an establishment can feel daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. When you go to the mechanic, I’m sure you don’t mind leaving the clutter behind, but when booking an interior, they need full access to every nook and cranny. Scared of getting upsold on your service? Well I know how to prevent it. 
Clean out your car for interior details:
	Detailers need full, open access to the entirety of your car. When leaving stuff in, it requires them to take everything out and place it to the side, keeping it as organized as possible. But it is so easy to leave things out of the car, mix it up with someone else's stuff, or break a fragile item. When dealing with a handful of customers, it is hard to be responsible for personal items, especially if they are mixed with trash. To keep your valuables safe and out of the way, clean out any valuable items in the car, we can take care of the trash. 
Rinse off your car for exterior details:
	In order to understand exactly what needs to be done to the paint, detailers need a good look at all angles. If it is coated with dust and dirt, it is hard to see how much damage could be hidden beneath. This also can give you and the detailer reassurance about prior damage, allowing both parties to be aware if anything damaged it further while in the shop. 
Get an inspection before agreeing to the service:
Car detailers are experts at finding hidden stains, rotting food, or bad paint spots, checking areas you didn’t think to look. For up front pricing, it is essential  to ask for a full inspection of your car. Most detailing spaces will offer it or do it automatically, but it is important for you to understand the process. If there is an excessive amount of dog hair, they may ask if you would like to add on a hair removal service. If your car is exceptionally dirty and covered in cigarette smoke, they may have to charge you an extended service fee. Sometimes mold can randomly appear and they have to charge a biohazard fee. An inspection gives you full confidence in the service you're paying for. 
Get a walkthrough once it is done:
	Never leave a detailing establishment without checking out the car. A great place will do it every time, and a good one will offer it to you. You spent money getting it professionally detailed, and it should be up to your standards. Detailers are also people too and can make mistakes. Please ensure that you are happy with the service you receive and get the most out of the experience. 
Aftercare:
	When you pick up the car, it will have a paper mat to protect the carpet from your dirty shoes, and a plastic covering over the driver's seat. Please keep your windows cracked until all the moisture has been dried, then feel free to put in the other mats that you may have. Locking moisture in a car can make it smell and grow mold, defeating the point of the service. If you just got an exterior detail done, make sure you regularly wash the outside. 
Conclusion
While this may seem like a lot to remember, if you have a great place to go to, this should not be a worry. Doing these steps ensures that you will have an enjoyable car detailing experience, making you want to go back more. It doesn’t have to be scary.

The Science of an Exterior Detail and the More Premium Services: 
An exterior detail is essentially a super deep clean of your clear coat. If you have swirls and surface level scratches, it will remove it. If you have deeper scratches, an exterior detail will help blend it in more, camouflaging it from inexperienced eyes. Sadly, things such as chips, cracks, and what is known as “crows feet” can only be fixed through restorative detailing. But how does the process work, and why does it work? 
Step 1: Hand Washing 
Handwashing a car, rather than sending it through an automatic car wash is much better for your paint. Automatic carwashes are the number one perpetrator for swirls scratches due to debris getting stuck in the rollers. Handwashing allows a detailer to remove any loose dirt before scrubbing the surface, leaving less room for damage. 
Step 2: Clay Bar 
There are a few different products that are used for this process. There’s clay pads, and an actual clay bar, but the function is exactly the same. Using this alongside some lubricant, it pulls out any imbedded contaminant from the paint. This can be dirt, railroad dust, and iron deposits. smoothing out your paint. If you have never gotten an exterior detail before, gently rub your fingers on a clean part of your car. That gritty feeling is the contaminates, once a clay bar is used, it turns smooth. 
Step 3: Buffing with Compound 
Buffing is an aggressive process, using a very fine grit to heat up the clear coat and refinish it. This is usually only recommended for paint corrections since it every time you did it. it thins out the paint. For all my girls out there, it’s basically exfoliating the paint, removing off all the dry clear coat to uncover the shiny part underneath. It is very finely sanding your car, removing the dull clear coat to uncover the next level. With deeper scratches, the ones that go into the paint layer, it evens out the gap between the top layer and that bottom layer, creating an illusion that is is the same level. 
Step 4: Polishing with Polish 
Polish is an even finer grit than compound. Due to the aggressive nature of buffing, it can leave behind some hazing, leading it to seem less shiny. Polish is used to correct that, and any swirls that may have been made during the buffing progress. This skims the clear coat and is used to gently shine up the paint. This is the part that makes your car shine and sparkle. 
Step 5: Protective Layer 
There are three different ways to protect the work of the paint: wax, sealant wax, and a ceramic coating. 
Wax:
Wax is the most simple option of the three, offering less protection. It is applied on the car, then wiped off, leaving a hydrophobic layer, protecting it from rain and UV rays, which lasts around 1-3 months. 
Sealant wax:
Sealant wax is a step up from regular wax, adding the same value, but lasts around 3-6 months with proper maintenance.
Ceramic Coating:
Ceramic coating is the most premium protectant that you can get on your car, usually amounting to at least $800. It is a polymer applied to every surface of the car, protecting it from chemicals, chips, UV rays, and repels water and dirt. Depending on the brand and your maintenance it can last up to six years, making it worth the investment. I would advise to only get this service if your car is five years or younger since it is very expensive and wouldn’t match the investment. The one exception is classic cars. 

Exterior details can be very expensive, but they often require an immense amount of labor, which should take about six to ten hours to do. Protecting your paint from the harsh outdoors will allow it to shine continuously and retain a good resale value, and it’s just nice for your paint to look nice!

My Experience in Car Detailing 
Hello, my name is Jackie Thomas and for about three years I was a car detailer. I did this alongside technical school, studying automotive customization for three years. I loved detailing so much that I did not want to branch out of it, so I stuck with it. It was one of the best jobs I have ever had, even though I had to eventually leave. But since it is a male-dominated industry, I certainly had distinct experiences as a woman. I don’t want to paint it in a bad light, but I want to raise awareness in hopes to do better.
